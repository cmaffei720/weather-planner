# weather-planner

A tool to show you the current weather, and a 5-day forecast for an addresss, city, or state of your choosing.

Searching for a location will find its latitude and longitude, and then send those coordinates into the Open Weather API.

The Open Weather API then returns current and forecast weather for the location, displays it on the screen, and stores that search in a list and in local storage.
